1. 指令级并行
2. 指令动态调度
3. 调度代码
4. Important in-core features
   1. pipeline
   2. superscalarity
   3. simd
   4. simultaneous multi-threading

5. simd
   1. 256bit
   2. X86 SIMD instruction sets
   3. sse 128
   4. avx(2) 256
   5. avx-512 512
   6. Loop unrolling
      1. This should not be done by hand

6. memory hierarchy
   1. Data transfers are the #1 limiting factor in computing

7. Single core

8. Parallelism is already built into the single core
   1. mostly addressed by compiler
   2. manual optimizations may still be useful sometimes

shared-memory parallel computer

distributed-memory systems 

"hybrid" distributed-/shared-memory systems
- Cluster of networked shared-memory nodes
- ccNUMA architecture per node
- Multiple cores per ccNUMA domain

- Expect strong topology effects in communication performance
  - Intra-socket, inter-socket, inter-code, all ahve different \lambda and b
